\begin{hxdescription}
Computes a 2D planar distance map for a given foreground segmentation
(foreground voxels with label field values > 0).

For each foreground label: Compute the plane that approximates the surrounding label field
in the best possible way. Then shoot rays inside this plane to compute the distance to the
nearest background voxel.

Plane approximation starting from point P: The standard-solution is to shoot rays in all 3D directions and to
compute the intersection points of these rays with the background. The plane is then
the best fitting plane regarding these points (in least squares sense; and translated to go
through P). As a second option, it is possible to take all voxel positions
of foreground voxels around P (in a neighborhood) and do a PCA on these positions. The first 2
eigenvectors span the computed plane.

Distance computation in plane: The distance can be computed one-directional, two-directional or
in an average sense.

This module was used for distance map computation for the tesserae segmentation project.

\begin{hxconnections}
\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_data}
\hxport{Data}{\tt [required]}\\
Label field: foreground segmentation

\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_sphere}
\hxport{Sphere}{\tt [optional]}\\
If the plane is approximated by shooting 3D rays, you have to attach a sphere mesh at
this port to determine the number of rays. Use the HxCreateSphere module (only change
"Number Of Points Per Unit^2" port) to create the sphere.

\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_planeNormals}
\hxport{Plane Normals}{\tt [optional]}\\
Only for experts: Attach a normal field if plane normals were already computed.

\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_visualizationlandmarks}
\hxport{Visualization Landmarks}{\tt [optional]}\\
Only for experts: Attach one landmark, and select "Landmark sphere visualization" at the "Type" port,
then the module returns the 3D background intersection points as landmarks. There is no distance
map computation.

\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_mask}
\hxport{Mask}{\tt [optional]}\\
Label field. If used the distance map values are ony computed where the mask values are larger 0.

\hximage{HxPlaneDistanceMap_type}\\
For "Sphere" / "No Sphere" see the intro text above.
For "Landmark sphere visualization" see the description of the "Visualization Landmarks" port.


\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_distance}
\hxport{Distance}\\
\hximage{HxPlaneDistanceMap_distance}\\
For distance computation rays are shot inside the already computed plane and the nearest background
intersection points are computed. "one-directional" means that the distance map value is the shortest
distance to a background voxel going in one direction. "two-directions" means that each ray is
followed forewards and backgwards, the distances to the nearest background intersection points are
added. "average" means all one-directional distances are averaged.


\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_numberOfRays}
\hxport{Number Of Rays}\\
\hximage{HxPlaneDistanceMap_numberOfRays}\\
Number of rays shot in the already computed plane (for distance computations).

\hxlabel{HxPlaneDistanceMap_sizebox}
\hxport{sizebox}\\
\hximage{HxPlaneDistanceMap_sizebox}\\
Only used if the "No sphere" option is used. The value determines the neighborhood size
(length of neighborhood box sides is 2 times this value).
