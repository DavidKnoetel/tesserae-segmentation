\begin{hxdescription}
Given a scalar field and a label field there are 2 ways to compute average values:

1. Compute the average value in a neighborhood for all voxels inside the given label field.
The neighborhood contains all voxels that are in the label field and in a cube around the current voxel.
The port size determines the size of this cube (sidelength / 2).
The output is a scalar field.

2. Compute average values in neighborhoods around the labels (one value per label).
The result is written in a spreadheet.
The neighborhood is computed via dilation (using ball, size is taken from size port and equals
half-kernel size). The average is computed for all voxels inside the dilation and not inside the original label,
additionaly only values larger than a given threshold are taken into calculation.

Returns a label field with value 1 for all voxels inside
the neighborhood (size controlled by "Size" port) around a given
voxel. Used for the visualization of the neighborhood for
a paper. Voxel coords are set in the "Visualize Coords" port.
