\begin{hxdescription}
This module evaluates a segmentation, given as a uniform scalar field, against a set of landmarks. For each landmark,
a corresponding voxel is computed. It is either the nearest voxel or the nearest foreground voxel (using BFS).
The label field is evaluated at this voxel position and a counter for the label found there is increased (label was hit
by the landmark). This counter value and several
derived measures are output as a spreadsheet with one line per label. For a perfect segmentation, each hit counter (except for the background label)
equals 1, i.e. each label is hit by exactly one marker. Additionally, there is a second table in the spreadsheet with summarized information
containing data like the number of correct labels, numer of clusters, ..., and finally the precision and recall value.

Select whether you want to use the voxel that is the nearest to a given landmark ("Direct neighbors"),
or if you want to exclude background voxels by searching for the nearest foreground
voxel (using BFS).
